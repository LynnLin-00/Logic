# This file tests the functions that are accessible through the command line:
#
# You will need to wrap these functions around whatever you have written. The assumption
# is that you have each of these already written.
#
# This file assumes that you have a class "kb" for your knowledge base
#
# You need to have your code in the file logic.py
#
# For your testing, this file plus the three data files (asserts.txt, retracts.txt, and
# ask.txt) all have to be in the same folder.
#
# This file directly tests the following:
#
# ASSERT (here called KB_assert. It take either a statement or a rule and
# adds them to the knowledge base. It then checks to see if there are any inferences
# based on existing rules and facts that can be made.
#
# ASK (here called KB_ask). It takes a statement and returns a list of bindings that
# can be used to instantiate that pattern.
#
# INSTANTIATE (here called instantiate) that takes a pattern and a set of bindings
# and builds a new, complete statement
#
# RETRACT (here called KB_retract) that takes a statement (not a rule) and removes
# it from the knowledge base and then removes all facts and rules that it might support.
#
# WHY (here called KB_why) that takes a statement, finds facts that match it and then maps
# out the facts and rules that support it.
#
# ASK+ (here called KB_ask_plus) that takes a list of statements and returns the lists
# of the various bindings that have to hold for those statements to be true in the data.
#
# The test file also displays the instantiated list of input statements instantiated with
# the each of the bindings that were found
